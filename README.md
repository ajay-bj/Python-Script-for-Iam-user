Step 1: Set up Boto3
Before you begin, you'll need to have Boto3 installed and configured with your AWS credentials. You can install Boto3 using pip and configure your AWS credentials using the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) or by setting environment variables. Make sure your AWS CLI is configured with the necessary permissions to create IAM users.

Step 2: Write the Python Script
Create a Python script to create an IAM user. You can use a code editor or IDE of your choice to write the script. Here's an example script that creates an IAM user- see above


Step 3: Run the Python Script
Save the script with a ".py" extension and execute it using Python. Make sure your AWS credentials are correctly configured to allow the creation of IAM users.
Here's how you can run the script:
bash -python iam_user.py

Step 4: Verify the User
After running the script, it will create an IAM user with the specified username. You can verify the user's existence by logging into the AWS Management Console or by using the AWS CLI:
aws iam list-users
You should see the IAM user you created in the list
